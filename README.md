# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project for a simple website that displays multiple recipes using basic HTML structure.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate:
- Knowledge of HTML elements and structure
- Use of relative links between pages
- Use of ordered and unordered lists
- Use of images
- Good file organization practices
